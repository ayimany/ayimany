# About Me

I am a robotics engineer with a passion for automation and quality control.
I am also the proud founder of the upcoming [FXST](https://github.com/fxstlabs), which you can learn more about in our page.

> [!WARNING]
> Recently, I have decided to make some drastic changes to how I wish to organize my life and projects, so I **have hidden / deleted several repositories** which I intend to bring back soon but, please, be patient.

Some examples of the things I have worked with are:
- Advanced robotic control systems
- Robotic vision applications
- CAD modeling
- Smart home device enablers
- IoT applications
- A variery but small yet fun programming langauges
- Minecraft Mods (You might still be able to find some really old ones)
- Discord bots

You can learn more about me on my:

<sup>1. I actually really dislike LinkedIn: most people feel like a depressing soulless robot. Sadly, it has a monopoly on professional networking which I hope to change some day.</sup>
